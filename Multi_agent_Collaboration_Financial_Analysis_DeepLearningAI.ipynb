            "\n",
            "2. **Position Sizing**: Managing the size of each trade can help control risk. For a medium risk tolerance, traders might limit each trade to 2-3% of their total trading capital.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Volatility-Based Trading**: Given AAPL's historical and implied volatility, traders can use volatility-based indicators such as Bollinger Bands or the Average True Range (ATR) to make informed trading decisions.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Options Trading**: Utilizing options can provide flexibility in managing risk. For example, buying puts or calls can help hedge against potential losses or lock in profits.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Technical Analysis**: Incorporating technical analysis can help identify trends and support/resistance levels, aiding in making more informed entry and exit decisions.\n",

            "6. **Diversification**: Although focusing on AAPL, diversifying trades across different assets or sectors can help mitigate risk.\n",

            "\n",
            "### Options Strategies\n",
            "- **Cash Secured Puts (CSPs)**: Selling puts while holding cash to buy the stock at the strike price if assigned.\n",

            "1. **Stop-Loss Orders**: Setting stop-loss orders can help limit losses if the stock price moves against the trader's position. For AAPL, a stop-loss could be set at 5-10% below the entry price.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Position Sizing**: Managing the size of each trade can help control risk. For a medium risk tolerance, traders might limit each trade to 2-3% of their total trading capital.\n",

All Rights Reserved. About Barchart | Affiliate Program | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy | Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information | Cookie Settings Technical Analysis The Technical Analysis page contains the results of 12 common technical analytics over different periods of time. The analytics used are: Moving Average Price Change Percent Change Average Volume The Moving Average is the average price of the security or contact for the Period shown. For example, a 9-period moving average is the average of the closing prices for the past 9 periods, including the current period. For intraday data the current price is used in place of the closing price. The moving average is used to observe price changes. The effect of the moving average is to smooth the price movement so that the longer-term trend becomes less volatile and therefore more obvious. When the price rises above the moving average, it indicates that investors are becoming bullish on the commodity. When the price falls below, it indicates a bearish commodity. As well, when a moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average, the study indicates a down turn in the market. When a short-term moving average crosses above a longer term moving average, this indicates an upswing in the market. The longer the period of the moving average, the smoother the price movement is. Longer moving averages are used to isolate long-term trends. The Price Change and associated Percent Change is the difference between the current Last Price, and the Last Price from the Period shown. For Commodities, the Average Volume figure is the average for the individual contract over the specified period of time. Raw Stochastics Stochastic %K Stochastics %D Average True Range The stochastic values simply represent the position of the market on a percentage basis versus its range over the previous n-period sessions. The percentage scale runs from zero to 100%. The Stochastic Indicator shows where a security's price closed in relation to its price range over the specified time period. There are three primary stochastic values: Raw Stochastic - the most basic value representing the stochastic value for each period. This is also referred to as raw K. %K - the first smoothing of the raw stochastic, usually with a 3-period exponential moving average. %D - the smoothing of the %k value, usually with another 3-period exponential moving average. Also known as slow K. High Average True Range values often occur at market bottoms following a \"panic\" sell-off. Low Average True Range values are often found during extended sideways periods, such as those found at tops and after consolidation periods. The True Range indicator is the greatest of the following: The price difference from today's high to today's low. The price difference from yesterday's close to today's high. The price difference from yesterday's close to today's low. Relative Strength Percent R Historic Volatility  MACD Oscillator (MACD Oscillator is calculated against the 3-Day Moving Average) The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of the most popular overbought/oversold (OB/OS) indicators. The RSI is basically an internal strength index which is adjusted on a daily basis by the amount by which the market rose or fell. It is most commonly used to show when a market has topped or bottomed. A high RSI occurs when the market has been rallying sharply and a low RSI occurs when the market has been selling off sharply. The RSI is expressed as a percentage, and ranges from zero to 100%. Williams Percent R was developed by Larry Williams. It indicates overbought/oversold market conditions, and is expressed as a percentage, ranging from zero to 100%. Percent R is the inverse of the Raw Stochastic. Historic volatility is the standard deviation of the \"price returns\" over a given number of sessions, multiplied by a factor (260 days) to produce an annualized volatility level. A \"price return\" is the natural logarithm of the percentage price changes or ln[Pt/P(t-1)]. A volatile market therefore has a larger standard deviation and thus a higher historical volatility value. Conversely, a market with small fluctuations has a small standard deviation and a low historical volatility value. Historical volatility is available on a daily chart, and on the Technicals Summary page for an individual ticker symbol/commodity contract. Historical volatility can also be used as a tool by traders who are trading only the underlying instrument. Quantifying the volatility in a market can affect a trader's perception of how far the market can move and thus provides some help in making price projections and placing orders. High volatility may indicate a trend reversal as heavy buying/selling comes into the market and may sharp price reversals. The MACD Oscillator is the difference between a short-term and a long-term moving averages. When the MACD Oscillator is above the zero line, conventional wisdom interprets this as a bullish signal, and conversely, when the histogram is below the zero line this is interpreted as a bearish signal. The red line being above the green line reinforces a bullish signal, and the red line below the green line reinforces a bearish signal. Other interpretations use crossovers between the red and green lines as market timing signals if the resulting direction of both lines is the same. Going up is bullish, going down is bearish. Technicals are calculated and updated every 20 minutes during the trading day using delayed market data. Alerts on Technicals Barchart Premier users can set Alerts on Technicals. Alerts are triggered using the same delayed data (calculated every 20 minutes) as shown on this page.  Barchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43) Want to use this as your default charts setting?

            "Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It’s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\n",
            "Volatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security’s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\n",
            "Another measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n",

This principle suggests that prices, returns, or economic indicators often move back towards their historical averages over time. Such a tendency indicates that extreme values, whether exceptionally high or low, are typically followed by a reversion towards the mean, signifying a statistical equilibrium.For retail traders, understanding the concept of mean reversion is crucial, as it enhances their ability to develop effective mean reversion trading strategies, thereby improving their decision-making in various market scenarios.The structure of this articleI have structure this article as follows to make sure it provides value to both new and more experienced traders alike. First, we will study mean reversion as concept using simple and easy to understand graphs.Then we briefly touch upon the statistics behind the concept.I will then show you how you can apply the concept when planning your trading strategy.Next we take a closer look at markets with a statistical tendency to revert to the mean.Utilizing a mean reversion trading strategy in financial marketsMean reversion is a pivotal concept in financial markets, essential for traders and investors across forex, stock, bond, and commodities trading. This strategy hinges on the principle that prices tend to return to their historical average. When an asset's price significantly deviates from this mean, traders may buy at lower prices if it's undervalued and sell at higher prices if overvalued, anticipating a return to the average.The mean reversion trading strategy capitalises on these price deviations. In a sideways market, when an asset's price markedly diverges from its mean, it is often expected to revert, offering potential trading opportunities. By identifying overbought or oversold conditions, traders can make informed decisions, buying low and selling high.This article aims to guide you in reducing risk and maximising profit. It will assist in distinguishing between trending and non-trending market regimes, aiming for more consistent and, ideally, profitable outcomes.Mean reversion and different market regimesIn ranging markets, a specific market regime, the mean reversion trading strategy becomes particularly effective. Prices in these markets tend to revert to the mean, indicating that when an asset's price diverges from its historical average, it's likely to return to that average eventually. Traders often exploit this tendency by buying low and selling high as prices fluctuate within a range.In contrast, in trending markets, the likelihood of mean reversion diminishes. In these regimes, prices exhibit a consistent, directional movement, either upward (bullish) or downward (bearish). During these phases, investors may observe prices moving away from their historical means without prompt corrections. Consequently, in trending markets, traders usually adopt strategies that align with the trend, seeking to maximize gains from the price movement.Recognizing these market distinctions is vital as it guides the selection of trading strategies and informs risk management decisions according to the current market regime.In the image on the left the price is ranging making it highly likely that it returns to the mean (average) whereas on the right the price is trending higher showing no indication of returning to the mean.A brief look at statistics behind the concept of mean reversionMean (Average): The mean is the average value of a dataset. It's calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of data points. For example, if you have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the mean is (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3.Standard Deviation: The standard deviation measures how spread out the data points are from the mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation suggests that the data points are more spread out.Measuring mean reversion statistically: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test: The ADF test is a specific statistical test used to determine if a time series data set exhibits mean reversion. I will explain later in the article how systematic traders use this statistical tool to find markets to trade using a mean reversion trading strategy (or strategies).How to create a mean reversion trading strategy?Select the Right Market: To employ a mean reversion trading strategy, choose a market that is known for exhibiting mean reversion behaviour. This could include stocks, currency pairs, or commodities that historically oscillate around a moving average. Avoid the markets that have had strong trends recently.Data Analysis: Analyse historical data to identify periods when the market demonstrates significant mean reversion tendencies and study price action in several timeframes during those periods. Look for periods when price ranges (reverts to the mean), as these periods can provide you with potential entry points.Determine Timeframes: Decide on the timeframe that suits your trading strategy. Different timeframes may exhibit varying degrees of mean reversion. Shorter timeframes may provide more frequent but smaller opportunities, while longer timeframes may offer larger, albeit less frequent, opportunities.Entry and Exit Rules: Develop clear and precise entry and exit rules for your mean reversion trading strategy. For example, you might enter a long position when the asset's price is below the mean and near to a support level and exit when it crosses above the mean (or alternatively rallies to the opposite end of the range). Conversely, enter a short position when the price is above the mean and near to a resistance level. Exit when the price falls below the mean or moves down to the lower end of the range. Ensure your rules include specific price thresholds or technical indicators.Mean reversion trading strategy trade entry signalsBollinger Bands can be a systematic way to determine when to buy and sell during mean-reverting price action. Bollinger Bands serve as dynamic support and resistance levels in trading. When the price touches the lower band, it often indicates a potential long entry point, suggesting that the asset is oversold. Conversely, contact with the upper band may signal an opportunity for a short entry, implying the asset is overbought.Traders using a mean reversion trading strategy should look for confirmation with a price reversal candlestick pattern near these bands. The mean line, typically a moving average, can act as an exit point or to assess trend strength. In the provided graph, the blue and red arrows highlight potential entry points.Using Bollinger bands in a mean reversion trading strategyBollinger Bands, with their dynamic support and resistance levels, rely on statistics. They are typically set at 2 standard deviations (2 sd.) from the mean, encompassing about 95% of price data.When the price touches the upper band, indicating overbought conditions, it suggests a potential short entry in our mean reversion trading strategy. Conversely, touching the lower band, signalling oversold conditions, may imply a long entry but you might want to look for a candlestick pattern to confirm these signals.The bands adapt to market volatility, widening when it's high and contracting in calmer markets. In essence, Bollinger Bands offer statistically grounded guidance for traders, capturing the majority of price movements within the 2 sd. bands.Risk Management: Implement robust risk management practices. This involves setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and not allocating too much capital to a single trade. Consider risk-reward ratios to ensure that potential profits outweigh potential losses.When trading a mean reversion trading strategy, profits are made in range-bound markets with profit targets relatively close to trade entries. Therefore, implementing robust risk management is crucial. This requires setting stop-loss orders just outside the range to cap potential losses if the price breaks out instead of reverting. Diversify capital across multiple trades to avoid excessive exposure on a single position.Calculate risk-reward ratios for each trade, aiming for a minimum of 2:1 to ensure that the expected returns justify the risks taken. Continuously monitor the trades for potential range breaches and adjust stop-losses accordingly to protect capital. Discipline in adhering to these rules is key to long-term profitability.Backtesting: Test your strategy using historical data to evaluate its effectiveness. This step helps you refine your entry and exit rules, as well as assess the strategy's overall performance under different market conditions.Monitoring and Adaptation: Continuously monitor the market and your strategy's performance. Be prepared to adapt your strategy as market conditions change. Mean reversion may not always hold, so decide under what circumstances you will stop using the mean reversion trading strategy and use a trend following trading approach instead.Psychological Discipline: Maintain emotional discipline. Trading based on mean reversion requires patience and adherence to your predefined rules. Emotional decisions can lead to costly mistakes.Review and Improvement: Regularly review and improve your trading strategy. Keep a trading journal to document your trades and analyse what worked and what didn't. Make adjustments accordingly to enhance your strategy's performance over time.By following these steps, you can create solid trading strategies that benefit from mean reversion with an aim to capitalize on price movements that tend to revert to their historical averages. Please remember, that no trading strategy is flawless; losses are inevitable. However, the key to successful trading isn't flawlessness but positive expectancy.Mean reversion trading strategy with a positive expectancyPositive expectancy means that over a series of trades, a strategy is expected to yield a net profit. It acknowledges that while individual trades may incur losses, the strategy's overall outcome is profitable. Traders focus on maximizing gains when they're right and minimizing losses when they're wrong. By maintaining a positive expectancy, even with occasional setbacks, traders can achieve consistent profitability over time, emphasizing the importance of a well-structured strategy and disciplined risk management rather than seeking perfection in every trade.How can we know if a market is suitable for a mean reversion trading strategy?Technical analysis: To identify markets suitable for a mean reversion strategy, traders can observe the behaviour of Simple Moving Averages (SMA) with periods of 20 and 30. When both SMAs move sideways and roughly in the middle of the recent price range, it indicates a ranging market.In this context, ranging means that prices are fluctuating within a defined range without a clear trend. Traders recognize this as an opportunity for mean reversion strategies. They can buy near the lower end and sell near the upper end of the range, anticipating price reversals to the mean. However, caution is essential as ranging markets can transition into trends, requiring strategy adjustments as market conditions evolve.Statistical analysis: To determine if a market is statistically prone to mean reversion behaviour and suitable for a mean reversion trading strategy, a trader can follow a concise process. First, apply the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to the market's price or asset data. Focus on the test statistic and p-value: a highly negative test statistic and a low p-value suggest stronger mean reversion tendencies. You can use for instance Chat GPT 4 to perform this test provided you have the price data for the market you are looking to analyse.How is mean reversion tendency measured statistically?The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, a tool for evaluating mean reversion, examines if a dataset, such as stock indices or forex pairs, typically returns to its average value. We applied this test to both the NASDAQ index and the EURGBP pair, assessing their tendencies to revert to their averages. The test's null hypothesis suggests that such series are non-stationary, lacking a stable mean and variance, indicating that they may follow persistent trends instead of oscillating around a consistent average. The tests were carried out by using Chat GPT-4 and daily data from Tradingview so that you are better equipped to choose the markets in which apply a mean reversion trading strategy.In a study covering the period from 1st January 2017 onwards, we applied the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to the NASDAQ index to assess its tendency towards mean reversion. The results revealed a test statistic of -0.397, which is higher than the critical values at the 1% (-3.4341), 5% (-2.8632), and 10% (-2.5676) significance levels. This indicates the failure to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root, suggesting that the Nasdaq index is non-stationary.Therefore, based on this analysis, the NASDAQ index does not exhibit mean-reverting behaviour in the examined timeframe. Visual observation of the daily NASDAQ index chart above confirms the statistical study as we can see how NASDAQ index chart tends to trend more than the EURGBP chart below.In the analysis of the EURGBP currency pair for the period starting from 1st January 2017, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test yielded a test statistic of -3.992, significantly more negative compared to the Nasdaq index's result. The p-value was found to be 0.00145, substantially lower than that of the Nasdaq.These results, particularly the test statistic being lower than the critical value at the 1% level (-3.4339), indicate a rejection of the null hypothesis of a unit root. This suggests that the EURGBP currency pair is stationary and therefore exhibits a higher likelihood of mean reversion. Therefore, EURGBP is probably a better market to use a mean reversion trading strategy in.Exploring mean reversion with the ADF testConsequently, it shows a greater tendency to revert to its average value over time in this study period, compared to the Nasdaq index. It is imperative to emphasize that while the ADF test provides valuable insights into mean reversion, it is just one of many tools employed in financial analysis. Interpretation should be approached with caution, considering the broader context and incorporating additional analytical techniques to form a comprehensive understanding of market behaviour.Implications of our study for mean reversion trading strategiesFor traders considering a mean reversion trading strategy, where the aim is to profit from prices returning to their average, our analysis offers valuable insights. The NASDAQ, with its high p-value from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, shows little tendency towards mean reversion. This implies that a mean reversion strategy might not be as effective in the NASDAQ market, as prices do not regularly return to an average value. On the other hand, the EURGBP currency pair, with a significantly lower p-value, indicates a stronger inclination towards mean reversion. Therefore, traders looking to apply a mean reversion strategy might find more potential opportunities in trading EURGBP compared to the NASDAQ.Mean reversion trading strategy during different market regimesTherefore, mean reversion trading strategies can be particularly effective in markets where price movements exhibit cyclical or oscillating patterns. However, as discussed before, the effectiveness of mean reversion strategies significantly varies across different market regimes. It therefore follows that we could improve our hit rate by trading the markets that are prone to mean reverting behaviour and use our mean reversion trading strategy only when the market in question is in a range bound mode. During stable or range-bound markets, mean reversion strategies often perform well as prices fluctuate within a predictable range, reverting back to a mean value after reaching overbought or oversold levels. Conversely, in trending or volatile markets, where prices move strongly in one direction, mean reversion strategies may be less effective. In these conditions, prices may not revert to the mean quickly or reliably, leading to potential losses.Choosing currency pairs for trading a mean reversion trading strategyTraders employing a mean reversion trading strategy may prefer cross currency pairs over USD pairs due to several advantages. Cross currency pairs, such as EURGBP or GBPCAD, often exhibit stronger mean-reverting tendencies as they are less influenced by the US dollar's dominant role in global markets.Traders may find other FX pairs e.g. USD pairs, are likely to move in trends due to several factors. Economic divergence, as seen in for instance GBPUSD, involves distinct economic cycles, interest rates, and inflation rates between the UK and the US, leading to higher volatility.Geopolitical factors unique to the UK and the US, including politics, trade, and global events, can introduce added volatility. Additionally, the US dollar's safe-haven status can lead to sharp movements in GBPUSD during uncertain times. Differing market participants in these pairs may also contribute to greater price swings, making cross currency pairs potentially more suitable for mean reversion strategies.In conclusionAs you start your journey to explore mean reversion trading strategies and navigate the complexities of financial markets, it's important to have the right platform to execute your trades.

            "Trend following indicator trading strategies\n",
            "Trend following strategies and systems are popular, especially in the commodity markets, and we aim to shed some light on this type of trading in this article. We have written many articles that contain backtested trend following strategies with trading rules.\n",
            "What is trend following?\n",
            "Trend following is when you try to capture extended moves in the financial markets, either up or down, mostly for long-term gains. Once in a while prices tend to keep on going (enduring) and these are the moves trend followers like. The aim is to capture most of such moves, not all, but the majority of them.\n",
            "Trend followers are not trying to predict tops and bottoms. They are not trying to predict anything, really. The aim is, quite simply, to take advantage of moves in different asset classes in the anticipation that some of the positions go their way big time. There is zero forecasting involved.\n",
            "Trend followers might use different time frames and many asset classes to diversify in order to avoid big drawdowns. Having different strategies is important for a trend follower.\n",
            "What is a trend following strategy?\n",
            "A trend following strategy is a strategy that tries to capture big moves up or down (short). The easiest trading rules involve using a moving average crossover system. If the price is above the moving average, go (or stay) long. If the price is below the average, flip and sell short (or sell). \n",
            "What is a trend following strategy?\n",
            "What is a trend?\n",
            "A trend refers to the general direction in which the price of an asset is moving over a period of time. Trends can be classified as upward (bullish), downward (bearish), or sideways (neutral). Traders often try to identify and follow trends to make informed decisions about buying or selling assets.\n",
            "Trader Joe might argue recent price action is a longer-term mean reversion, while Jim sees a trend. This illustrates the complexity of trading:\n",
            "There is no exact universal definition of what a trend is. This is what a market is all about: a meeting place for different opinions and goals.\n",
            "Does this mean that it’s futile to look for trends? No, there are many ways to define trends. It’s all about rules and time frames:\n",
            "Many like to draw trendlines to define the trend. They pick bottoms or tops in the chart and draw lines between these. As long as the price is following the trendline, the trend is intact. When the price breaks out of the trendline, the trend is broken. Trends are primarily long-term – not short-term.\n",
            "We used the same technique some 20 years ago but found out this involves more hindsight than predictions. If you have success with it, congratulations, but this is not something we recommend. We believe a trend needs to be quantified:\n",
            "How to quantify a trend?\n",
            "Quantifying a trend in trading involves analyzing price movements over a specific period to determine the direction and strength of the market’s momentum. \n",
            "This website is about quantifying numbers and statistics, and trend following is no different. A trend needs to be objectively calculated by specific rules.\n",
            "This typically involves using technical indicators, such as moving averages or trend lines, to identify patterns and establish the trend’s duration, magnitude, and potential reversals.\n",
            "Trend following strategy\n",
            "For example, in the book The Four Cardinal Principles of Trading, one of the traders interviewed defined trends using an x-day moving average of the high. If the close was above the moving average, the trend was up until the close was below the x-day average of lows (the trend reversed). Pretty simple stuff.\n",
            "Likewise, in the stock market, many define the trend by using the 200-day moving average of the closing. If the price is above the average, the trend is up, and vice versa.\n",
            "Paul Tudor Jones once said that the 200-day average is like playing defense. Trading is about survival, and the 200-day moving average takes you out of trouble frequently: you are unlikely to get a huge drawdown, but you are frequently stopped out.\n",
            "Summary of Key Performance Metrics for our Trend Following Strategies below\n",
            "In analyzing trend following strategies, various backtested results reveal the efficacy and challenges of these approaches. Below is a summary table highlighting the critical statistics for several trend-following strategies based on a sample of diverse markets.\n",

            "These statistics provide insight into the potential returns and risks associated with each trend-following strategy, offering valuable information for traders considering these methods. While the returns can be substantial, the significant drawdowns highlight the necessity for robust risk management and psychological resilience.\n",
            "Trend following, characterized by its simplicity and systematic rules, remains a viable trading strategy, especially for those prepared to endure its inherent volatility and low win ratios.\n",
            "What are some trend-following strategies? \n",
            "A trend following strategy is trying to capture a significant move up or down in a financial asset. Some of the original Turtle Systems (the famous Turtle Experiment by Richard Dennis in the 1980s) were republished in Curtis Faith’s Way Of The Turtle: Here are some trend-following strategies:\n",
            "1) ATR Channel Breakout strategy\n",
            "This is a breakout system based on volatility. A seven ATR is added to the 350-day moving average of the closing prices, and three ATRs are subtracted from the 350-day moving average. A long position is initiated on the open the day after a close above the channel, and a short position if the close is below the channel.\n",
            "Trades are closed when they end up below (or over if short) the 350-day moving average.\n",
            "2) Bollinger Channel Breakout strategy\n",
            "A Bollinger Band channel is formed by adding a band of 2.5 standard deviations to the 350-day moving average. A long trade is entered on the open if the previous day’s close exceeded the top of the channel. A short trade is entered if the close is below the bottom band. This is completely the opposite of what a mean reversion strategy would do.\n",
            "Positions are closed when they cross the moving average.\n",
            "3) Donchian Trend strategy\n",
            "The Donchian trend system has two components: the trend filter requires the 25-day exponential moving average to be above the 350-day moving average. If the trend is up and the close sets a new 20-day high, a long position is initiated on the open the next day (and vice versa for short).\n",
            "This system uses a 2 ATR stop.\n",
            "4) Donchian Trend with Time Exit strategy\n",
            "This system uses the original Donchian rules but the exit is based on time: an exit is after 80 days without using any stops whatsoever. We recommend time exits and we covered this in an article called how and when to exit a trade.\n",
            "5) Dual Moving Average strategy\n",
            "As the name implies, the system uses two moving averages: a 100-day moving average and a 350-day moving average. This system is always in the market: Long when the shorter moving average is above the long moving average and vice versa. (We have backtested moving average trading strategies.)\n",
            "6) Triple Moving Average strategy\n",
            "This system uses three moving averages: 150, 250, and 350-day moving averages. Buy and sell occur when the 150-day moving average breaks above and below the 250-day moving average. The 350-day average is used as a trend filter: Trades happen only when both moving averages are on the same side as the longer 350-day average. If both are higher, long trades are permitted. If both are lower, only short trades are permitted.\n",
            "Trend-following Trading Performance\n",

            "How did the strategies perform? Let’s summarize:\n",
            "ATR CBO: 49.5% CAGR, 39.9% drawdown\n",
            "Bollinger CBO: 51.8% CAGR, 34.1% drawdown\n",

            "Donchian Time: 57.2% CAGR, 43.6% drawdown\n",
            "Dual MA: 57.8% CAGR, 31.8% drawdown\n",
            "Triple MA: 48.1% CAGR, 31.3% drawdown\n",
            "Before you start applying trend following strategies: remember that these are futures contracts and that involve leverage. Moreover, the drawdown is big and this type of trading suits very few traders: only two systems had a win ratio above 50%: Bollinger CBO and Donchian Time.\n",
            "Unfortunately, Curtis Faith doesn’t write about how these strategies would perform together as a portfolio. (We recommend Faith’s book. We believe this is the best of all the books about trend following. It’s a great read and available in pdf on the internet.)\n",
            "The best system measured in CAGR, the Dual Moving Average system, had a win ratio of only 39%! This makes the system very hard to trade for most of us. Please also keep in mind that trend following is mainly a long-term strategy, certainly not for day trading, perhaps not even for swing trading strategies or other short-term strategies.\n",
            "What were Curtis’ main takeaways?\n",
            "The best trend following trading strategies from the 1980s still seems to work. Trend following still works.\n",
            "Time-based exits are probably better than anything else.\n",
            "An entry that has an edge can account for the entire profitability of a system.\n",
            "Breakouts have probably lost some of their effects over time. Curtis calls this the trader effect (discussed below).\n",
            "The Dual Moving Average system performs better than the Triple Moving Average system, indicating simplicity trumps complexity.\n",
            "Stop-losses don’t improve performance, quite the contrary.\n",
            "Do trend-following strategies work?\n",
            "The observant reader quickly spots the simplicity of the strategies mentioned above. Can something so simple work? Isn’t the markets extremely complex? But yes, trend following works. We have written a separate article about why trend following works.\n",
            "One of the main reasons why trend-following works is that these strategies, most of the time, have a low correlation to other types of strategies (additionally, it works pretty well as a tail risk hedge strategy).\n",
            " Is trend following profitable?\n",
            "In the upper table below please look at the row that starts with MLM. MLM is the Mt Lucas Index that tracks a 200-day moving average trend-following strategy. The correlation is low to the overall stock market (S&P 500):\n",
            "Trend following vs other asset classes\n",
            "Many CTA indices track trend followers, such as the Barclay CTA Index. Many of the funds are also systematic (they use algorithms).\n",
            "Because trend following uses “simple” variables, they are more robust and not susceptible to curve fitting. That might explain why they are working, presumably decade after decade. No strategy can ever capture all the variables determining moves in the market, and hence it makes sense to make things as simple as you possibly can.\n",
            "Curtis Faith’s results show that straightforward systems can work exceptionally well in various markets. Because of their simplicity, we most likely can expect them to continue working in the future. The systems only require one element: movement.\n",
            "Some weeks ago, we tested trend following on the gold price and the S&P 500, which supported Curtis Faith’s results:\n",
            "Trend following strategy in gold\n",

            "Trend-following moves in cycles\n",
            "Periods of below-average returns are followed by periods of above-average returns. This happens all the time in the financial markets. \n",
            "Trend followers try to keep their heads above water when times are bad and rather bet on having infrequent spectacular gains. This can be very hard to stomach for many investors unfamiliar with the strategy. Human nature tends to think for the short term and withdraw funds at the wrong time. Waiting for the large outlier trend-following move requires patience and accepting big drawdowns.\n",
            "John Henry, one of the best-known trend followers, decided to close his shop a few years ago. Even the famous trend-follower Bill Dunn has had many tough years and subsequent dwindling assets under management. This is precisely why trend following is tough. \n",

            "Does trend following work for stocks?\n",
            "Trend following works for stocks in the medium and long term but not so well in the short term. There is also a difference between different sectors and whether you are trading board indices or single stocks. Single stocks trend a lot more than broad indices. We can argue that the trend is not your friend for stock indices in the short term. \n",
            "In general, most currencies and commodities show a tendency to trend more than stocks and/or stock indices (at least according to our research). \n",
            "Let’s look at a scatter plot for S&P 500 (the ETF SPY):\n",
            "Trend following stocks\n",
            "The plot shows the gain for two days and the next two-day period. The plot shows that if a 2-day period is positive, most likely, the next two days will show opposite returns. We did the same plot for different markets and got the following results:\n",

            "RSX: Russia -0.08\n",
            "EWZ: Brazil -0.11\n",
            "Trend followers like to keep things simple\n",
            "A back of an envelope algorithm is often good enough to compete with an optimal formula, and certainly good enough to outdo expert judgment.\n",
            "Micheal Covel made the statement above in his best-selling book about trend following. We believe he nailed it. The best thing about trend following is the magic that even “naive” systems seem to generate excellent results.\n",
            "Robust trading systems should be simple. This is not a contradiction, quite the opposite. You want systems that can handle the unpredictable, not those that are fitted to a specific market regime.\n",
            "The best way to make a robust system is to simplify and diversify. We have both covered the importance of that in previous articles. And, by the way, trading needs to be simple and easy.\n",
            "Curtis Faith stresses the importance of simplicity. The logic is simple: in times of change, complex species are more likely to die off. At those times, the hardiest species are those which are very simple, for example, viruses and bacteria. They are less dependent on their surroundings. In trading, if you have a complex system, you are more likely to face difficulties the bigger the market change.\n",
            "It’s easy to become a victim of market noise. There is an abundance of info, bells, whistles, indicators, commentaries, expert opinions, movement, etc., that make you deviate from your original plan. A simple strategy can help you rise above all the unnecessary market noise.\n",
            "But if trend following is so “simple”, why doesn’t it get “arbed” away?\n",
            "Why do trend-following strategies work? Why isn’t the strategies “arbed” away?\n",
            "Anything that repeats with enough consistency is likely to be noticed by several market participants. Similarly, a strategy that has worked especially well in the recent past is likely to be noticed by many traders. However, if too many traders start to try to take advantage of a particular strategy, that strategy will cease working as well as it did previously.\n",
            "Curtis Faith mentions the trader effect in chapter eleven of his book. The quote above is this effect – strategies get “arbed” away.\n",
            "However, despite being simple, trend-following strategies are not easy to follow.\n",
            "Why are trend following systems hard to follow?\n",
            "Trend following often experience many whipsaws that feel like “bleeding to death”. Most humans want the pleasure of winning frequently, and most of us prefer many small winners instead of occasionally “lump-sum” big gains. Read more below under “pros and cons”.\n",
            "When the win ratio is low, we are more prone to behavioral mistakes. No matter how good you are, it takes lots of experience to fight the most common trading biases.\n",
            "What markets trend the most? What are the best trending markets?\n",
            "Trend followers are mainly looking to capture big moves. Some markets are more prone to sudden and volatile moves than others. For example, the commodity market is most likely best suited for trend following, and we would also like to add the forex market, which tends to go in directions for months.\n",
            "The list provided by Curtis Faith above should guide you to the best markets.\n",
            "What are the best indicators for trend following strategies?\n",
            "Which is the best trend indicator? That is a tricky question to answer. However, you don’t need any fancy tools to determine the trend. As you’ve probably discovered by now, the straightforward moving average is an excellent tool for trend following.\n",
            "The great advantage of a moving average is its simplicity.\n",
            "However, there are other tools in the arsenal you can use:\n",
            "Top 10 best trend following indicators\n",
            "How do you create a trend following system?\n",
            "Creating a trend system is not much different than developing or building other trading systems. The same logic applies to all of them: to make a good entry, to have a proper exit, and you might want to have a stop-loss, although most trading systems work better without stops.\n",
            "However, capturing trends is not about making a perfect entry and exit. The main aim is to capture big moves, not noise and minor fluctuations. This leaves room for margins because you are not occupied with catching tops and bottoms, which many traders are concerned about.\n",
            "Tops and bottoms are only clear in hindsight. Forget the tops and bottoms and focus on the big picture.\n",
            "The cons of trend following strategies (disadvantages)\n",
            "Trend following is not like magic and has its disadvantages. It’s not a magical system that makes money without any downside. Trend following does not produce stock-like returns with bond-like risk.\n",
            "Even though the performance of a trend-following strategy seems to be better than that of its buy-and-hold counterpart, there are several caveats:\n",
            "Trend following is prone to sudden reversals\n",
            "You might take on a position and it slowly ticks your way until it one day suddenly reverses and heads down. When trend followers sell their positions, the sell-off is exacerbated, and volatility increases even more.\n",
            "Trend followers get whipsawed a lot\n",
            "Markets spend a lot of time going nowhere and you must expect to find yourself “stopped out” frequently. Sometimes this feels like bleeding slowly to death. This is probably the number one reason why most traders give up trend following.\n",
            "It’s human nature: it feels better to get a steady income instead of a random and rare lump-sum gain.\n",
            "What would you rather have? A steady gain of 50 000 a year over five years? Or would you prefer a gain of 250 000 in year one and nothing in the last four? In the latter example, you would have one great year and four years feeling miserable.\n",
            "We hope you get the point.\n",
            "Trend following has a low win ratio (hit ratio)\n",
            "Curtis Faith’s results above showed that the best strategy had a win ratio of 39%. This means most of your trades end up as losses. It looks so easy on a backtest, but we are confident that most traders can’t tolerate such a system. Most would have given up before the big win came.\n",
            "Trend followers need to fight the temptation to cut winners\n",
            "It would help if you rode the winners. This means you need to accept giving up large profits before the trend resumes, or you get stopped out. The old saying “you don’t go broke by taking profits” is utterly wrong for a trend follower.\n",
            "For most traders, it doesn’t feel right to buy at 50, see it go to 100, and then watch in disappointment the price drop to 70. It’s tough to be a trend follower.\n",
            "Trend following requires switching – thus liable to capital gains taxes\n",
            "Unless you have a tax-deferred account, you need to pay taxes on profits, which is a huge headwind to compound efficiently.\n",
            "Moreover, frequent switching also means you need to roll over futures contracts when they expire and subsequently, you need to add slippage and commissions.\n",
            "A few trades determine overall profits\n",
            "If you miss just one or a few good trades, your performance might suffer. The win ratio is low, and you are dependent on the few and rare very profitable trades.\n",
            "The profit distribution is different than in a mean reversion strategy. A mean reversion strategy is prone to “fat” left tails, while trend following has “fat” right tails.\n",
            "Tail risk hedging strategies\n",
            "Negatively skewed trading strategies\n",
            "The pros of trend following strategies\n",
            "Could the advantages offset the advantages? We let you decide:\n",
            "1) Trend following’s main advantage is the simplicity\n",
            "As we have described above, you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to exploit market moves. The strategies described in this article are pretty good evidence for that. Less is more in trading!\n",
            "2) Trend following doesn’t require a lot of time to manage\n",
            "Trend following works best on long time frames. You can probably do well even by using weekly bars/data and placing orders on Mondays, and doing absolutely nothing during the week.\n",
            "3) No timing is required for trend followers\n",
            "You don’t need to follow the markets daily. You are probably doing better the less time you spend following the markets.\n",
            "4) Trend followers are somewhat antifragile\n",
            "Mean revertive traders tend to blow off spectacularly, while trend followers bleed slowly. The latter, we believe, stand a better chance of surviving sharp and sudden moves in the market.\n",
            "Likewise, as shown in the links above, trend following strategies frequently have more big winners than big losers. The distribution tails are on the right side (the positive side).\n",
            "Does trend following fit your personality and trading style?\n",
            "At the end of the article, we have a general piece of advice:\n",
            "The success or fiasco in the markets is ultimately less about your strategies (your entries and exits), and more about your behavior. All traders make behavioral mistakes all the time, which might have a significant impact on trend followers, more so than mean reversion traders.\n",
            "Can you pull the trigger after six losing trades in a row? By employing mean reversion strategies you have many more winners and the occasional big loser. For trend followers, it’s the opposite. Thus, you must understand how you react after a series of losses.\n",
            "The truth is, most traders give up or don’t take the next signal after a series of losses.\n",
            "Moreover, can you handle being wrong at least 50% of the time? In trend following, the win ratio can sometimes even be lower than 50%! Trend following might seem easy in backtests and on paper, but it’s far from easy to perform flawlessly without behavioral mistakes.\n",
            "What is a trend following CTA?\n",
            "CTA is an abbreviation for Commodity Trading Advisor. This is a person, an individual, that gives specific advice on what to buy or sell for clients. CTAs are required to register in their self-regulatory organization (National Futures Association – NFA).\n",
            "Thus, a trend following CTA is someone (person or firm) that does trend following strategies.\n",
            "We have written more about CTA trading strategies in a separate article:\n",
            "CTA trading strategy\n",
            "Trend following ETFs\n",
            "There are a few trend following ETFs. The most obvious, in our opinion, is KFA Mount Lucas Strategy ETF. The ticker code is KMLM. We covered this ETF in depth in a previous article about do trend following strategies work.\n",
            "What’s a trend follower?\n",
            "That is someone trading trend-following strategies by using strictly quantified trading signals and settings. This way, he or she can backtest their strategy to check the historical performance, something which is highly recommended. \n",
            "What is systematic trend following?\n",
            "That’s someone using backtested rules and trading a portfolio of strategies. Typically, hedge funds are labeled “systematic” when they employ these strategies. \n",
            "Is trend following profitable?\n",
            "It depends on which assets you are trading. For example, trend following works much better among commodities than stocks. We don’t think it’s a good idea to walk into the office daily to have a particular liking of which strategy to trade. Backtest to find out what works or not, and start trading it. Don’t limit yourself!\n",
            "Does trend following still work?\n",
            "Indeed! But it goes in cycles. For example, 2022 has been a record year for many systematic trend followers after several lackluster years. \n",
            "What is the best trend following indicator?\n",
            "In trading, there are no definite answers. But the very simple 200-day moving average is a great trend filter. Simple, yet effective. We also believe the well-known ADX indicator is good at filtering trends. We like the ADX indicator, and we have used it among our strategies and strategy bundles you find in our shop.\n",
            "Trend following strategy example\n",
            "A good example of a trend-following strategy is the Weekend Trend Trader strategy. It was originally created by the Australian money manager Nick Radge, and based on his sound principles, we developed some trading rules. If trend trading interests you, we highly recommend clicking on the strategy (the trading rules are included). \n",
            "As an example, we show you the equity curve for the strategy when we backtested it on survivorship-free data for the S&P 400 Midcap:\n",
            "Trend following trading strategy example\n",
            "The backtest is from 1990 until today, and the CAGR (annual return) is an impressive 22.9% (303 trades). On the negative side, the max drawdown of 58% is perhaps a tad too high for most traders to stomach. However, the strategy is not optimized in any way and can surely be improved massively. We are impressed by the results, showing that keeping it simple gets you a long way.\n",
            "Conclusion\n",
            "The best trend following trading strategies from the 1980s still seems to work, albeit breakouts have probably lost some of their power. Curtis Faith revealed that the entry price is the most important factor and that stop-losses don’t tend to improve trend-following systems.\n",
            "That said, trend following is hard to practice because of the low win ratio. Can you handle inevitable drawdowns? Most people stop trading trend following systems because they simply can’t follow the rules!\n",

Larger texts indicate more widely used phrases.Risk Factors Full Breakdown - Total Risks 28 Legal & RegulatoryTotal Risks: 6/28 (21%)Above Sector AverageRegulation2 | 7.1%Regulation - Risk 1The Company's business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n",
            "The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n",
            "In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company's compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company's agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n",
            "Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Regulation - Risk 2ChangedThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company's business.The Company's global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; national security; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\n",
            "Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company's business by increasing the Company's costs, limiting the Company's ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company's products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company's products and services, and requiring changes to the Company's business or supply chain. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.\n",
            "Risks and costs related to new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities may increase as the Company's products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company's employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company's policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company's business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company's products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.read moreLitigation & Legal Liabilities1 | 3.6%Litigation & Legal Liabilities - Risk 1The Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\n",
            "The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\n",
            "Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company's cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company's ability to offer certain products and services.\n",
            "The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company's ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Taxation & Government Incentives1 | 3.6%Taxation & Government Incentives - Risk 1The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\n",
            "The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company's effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company's taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Environmental / Social2 | 7.1%Environmental / Social - Risk 1Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company's business.Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of the Company's announced goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company's control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company's goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.Environmental / Social - Risk 2Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information with respect to the Company's customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "The Company's business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company's behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company's ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company's stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which can result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company's ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.\n",
            "Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\n",
            "The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company's or its suppliers' and other third parties' employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company's or such suppliers' or third parties' systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company's products and services.\n",
            "While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.read moreAbility to SellTotal Risks: 6/28 (21%)Above Sector AverageCompetition2 | 7.1%Competition - Risk 1Global markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.The Company's products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\n",
            "The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\n",
            "The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company's competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company's intellectual property, the Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\n",
            "The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company's competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\n",
            "Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company's product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company's approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\n",
            "The Company's services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases.

The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\n",

The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Although the Company's compliance plan is intended to address the DMA's obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\n",
            "The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \"performance smartphones\" and \"smartphones\" generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",

For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC (\"Google\") and other companies to offer their search services on the Company's platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024, Google was found to have violated U.S. antitrust laws. In connection with this finding, the DOJ has proposed remedies, which include changes to Google's products, services and business models. The proposed changes vary in scope and severity and range from imposing significant restrictions on Google's licensing agreements to prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for search distribution for up to 10 years. If implemented, such remedies could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to earn revenue from such licensing arrangements.\n",

Changes to the Company's business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company's products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, lost sales, and lower profit margins.ProductionTotal Risks: 5/28 (18%)Above Sector AverageManufacturing1 | 3.6%Manufacturing - Risk 1The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company's products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company's services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a user's device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.Employment / Personnel1 | 3.6%Employment / Personnel - Risk 1The Company's success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company's ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.Much of the Company's future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company's key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company's culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\n",
            "The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Supply Chain2 | 7.1%Supply Chain - Risk 1The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company's flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company's hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company's cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or conflict.\n",
            "The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n",
            "Changes or additions to the Company's supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.Supply Chain - Risk 2Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company's business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.read moreCosts1 | 3.6%Costs - Risk 1The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n",
            "The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company's markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.Finance & CorporateTotal Risks: 4/28 (14%)Below Sector AverageShare Price & Shareholder Rights1 | 3.6%Share Price & Shareholder Rights - Risk 1The price of the Company's stock is subject to volatility.The Company's stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies' operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), and the Company's share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company's stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.Accounting & Financial Operations1 | 3.6%Accounting & Financial Operations - Risk 1The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.The Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company's products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company's gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company's services; the Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company's logistics, supply or manufacturing partners.Debt & Financing1 | 3.6%Debt & Financing - Risk 1The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.The Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.Corporate Activity and Growth1 | 3.6%Corporate Activity and Growth - Risk 1Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company's ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company's ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.

In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\n",
            "In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company's products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company's suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\n",
            "Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company's trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company's ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company's financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.Economy & Political Environment - Risk 2The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.Political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n",
            "The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company's business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company's business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the Company's business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business.\n",
            "Many of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company's and its suppliers' operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company's control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\n",
            "Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings, increase the Company's costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\n",
            "The Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company's business, and harm to the Company's reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company's operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\n",
            "Following any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.read moreCapital Markets2 | 7.1%Capital Markets - Risk 1The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company's exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 28, 2024, the Company's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.Capital Markets - Risk 2The Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n",
            "The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\n",
            "Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company's foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n",
            "The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.Technology2 | 7.1%Technology - Risk 1The Company's business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company's or its vendors' business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company's business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company's online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company's products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Technology - Risk 2The Company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.\n",
            "The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n",
            "The Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n",
            "The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company's products.\n",
            "The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the European Union (\"EU\") as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the \"DMA\"), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (\"APIs\") for developers. Changes to the Company's products and services could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated.read moreSee a full breakdown of risk according to category and subcategory.

This is so that potential investors can consider any risks before they make an investment.They also offer companies protection, as a company can use risk factors as liability protection. This could happen if a company underperforms and investors take legal action as a result.It is worth noting that smaller companies, that is those with a public float of under $75 million on the last business day, do not have to include risk factors in their 10-K and 10-Q forms, although some may choose to do so.How do companies disclose their risk factors?Publicly traded companies initially disclose their risk factors to the SEC through their S-1 filings as part of the IPO process.Additionally, companies must provide a complete list of risk factors in their Annual Reports (Form 10-K) or (Form 20-F) for “foreign private issuers”.Quarterly Reports also include a section on risk factors (Form 10-Q) where companies are only required to update any changes since the previous report.According to the SEC, risk factors should be reported concisely, logically and in “plain English” so investors can understand them.How can I use TipRanks risk factors in my stock research?Use the Risk Factors tab to get data about the risk factors of any company in which you are considering investing.You can easily see the most significant risks a company is facing. Additionally, you can find out which risk factors a company has added, removed or adjusted since its previous disclosure. You can also see how a company’s risk factors compare to others in its sector.Without reading company reports or participating in conference calls, you would most likely not have access to this sort of information, which is usually not included in press releases or other public announcements.A simplified analysis of risk factors is unique to TipRanks.What are all the risk factor categories?TipRanks has identified 6 major categories of risk factors and a number of subcategories for each.

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.\n",

            " In 2007, Apple, Inc. (AAPL) launched the iPhone to tremendous success. The vision of the company’s founder, Steve Jobs, came to fruition as Apple captured both mindshare and market share while redefining the hardware and software world. Along the way, it endeared itself to new generations of consumers.\n",
            " The resultant impact on the company's stock was even more impressive. In early January 2007, the price was around $3 to $4 and continued its rise through a global financial crisis to land around $227 in late 2024. With no end in sight, the rewards of holding AAPL seem limitless, but are there risks ahead that investors may be dangerously overlooking?\n",
            " Apple’s Rewards If you had been lucky (or some may call it brilliant) enough to envision the impact the iPhone would have on Apple’s earnings and margins and invested in the stock a decade ago, you would be ecstatic over the rewards garnered from your position. And while the stock has continually ignored the direction of the markets by moving (for the most part) in an upward trajectory, the question remains: Do the future rewards outweigh the risks? Let’s consider four points:\n",
            "Most analysts agree iPhone sales drive AAPL. Penetration into new markets, particularly the success of its venture in China, will largely determine if the company can produce strong year-over-year growth. The company can also explore new areas, such as game consoles, streaming services, watches, other “wearables,” and the TV/DVD/set-top box markets. And while these may produce avenues of future growth, they will not drive near-term (the next 18 months-two years) earnings growth like the expected growing domestic demand for the iPhone.\n",
            "In April 2014, the company announced a large capital return program in the form of share repurchases and dividend increases that rewarded shareholders. The expectation is that will be another similar announcement in 2015, the impact of which will be felt into 2016.\n",
            "Apple’s trailing price-to-earnings ratio is 17.1x (just slightly above the Standard & Poor’s valuation) with expected growth to outpace the market’s, making it an extremely attractive valuation.\n",
            "A strong cash position on its balance sheet is cited by many as a catalyst for growth, or at the very least, continued share repurchases. \n",
            " Apple’s Risks It is hard to compete with strong stock appreciation and anticipated continued strong growth, but there may be risks investors are overlooking.\n",
            " Again the focus is on the iPhone for near-term risks. A slowdown in the growth and penetration of the smartphone market could be exponentially more painful for Apple, as over half its current revenues come from its iPhone products. A slowdown in any of the following could materially reduce Apple’s multiple and stock price: overall smartphone market growth, iPhone market share growth, or penetration into China. Considering that analysts’ predictions for iPhone sales are bullish for this year, next year could show negative comps or a year-over-year decline, which would effectively knock down the stock's multiple. \n",
            " Future growth is dependent on new product categories or on a product that would redefine a current category. Some skeptics wonder why the company is so keen on returning its cash via share repurchases and dividends instead of re-investing into research and development or making acquisitions. There is the risk that the company will be unable to sustain its “innovative” strategy in the future because it is not putting that cash to work today to discover the technology of tomorrow. \n",
            " The Bottom Line Apple has been synonymous with growth and innovation, capturing all of a consumer’s technology dollars with its personal computing (Mac), smartphone (iPhone), and tablet (iPad) products, effectively raising switching costs to an undeniably high level. The risks lie in the company’s future ability to keep those consumers while drawing in new ones in more markets. New technology makes consumers fickle. They want the newest and best, and brand loyalty will be sacrificed to own the next greatest gadget. The risk is that Apple will not be in the running when the new wave comes rolling in. \n",

Apple’s iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple’s other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple’s sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution. \n",

            "The proposed trading strategy for AAPL involves buying when the price rebounds from the support zone near $193 and selling when the price approaches the resistance zone near $212.50.

            "2. **Position Sizing Risk**: The position sizing of 2-5% of the total portfolio may not be sufficient to manage risk, and a larger position size could lead to significant losses if the trade does not work out.\n",
            "3. **Stop-Loss Risk**: The stop-loss orders may be triggered by short-term market volatility, leading to unnecessary losses.\n",

            "2. **Competition Risk**: AAPL faces significant competition in the global smartphone, personal computer, and tablet markets, which could affect its market share and profitability.\n",
            "3. **Supply Chain Risk**: AAPL relies on a complex global supply chain, which is subject to various risks, including natural disasters, information technology system failures, and commercial disputes.\n",
            "4. **Technology Risk**: AAPL's business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions, which could materially adversely affect the company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n",

            "## Evaluation of the Proposed Trading Strategy:\n",
            "\n",
            "The proposed trading strategy for AAPL appears to be based on a technical analysis of the stock's price movements. While the strategy includes risk management measures such as position sizing and stop-loss orders, it is essential to consider the risks associated with AAPL stock and the overall market.\n",
            "\n",
            "The current market conditions, including a current price of $202.82 USD, market capitalization of $3.03T USD, dividend yield of 0.51%, and beta of 1.09, suggest that AAPL is a large-cap stock with a relatively stable market position.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the historical data shows that AAPL stock has been range-bound between $193 and $212.50 for the past two months, which may indicate a high risk of losses if the stock price breaks out of this range.\n",

Larger texts indicate more widely used phrases.Risk Factors Full Breakdown - Total Risks 28 Legal & RegulatoryTotal Risks: 6/28 (21%)Above Sector AverageRegulation2 | 7.1%Regulation - Risk 1The Company's business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n",
            "The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n",
            "In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company's compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company's agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n",
            "Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Regulation - Risk 2ChangedThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company's business.The Company's global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; national security; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\n",
            "Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company's business by increasing the Company's costs, limiting the Company's ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company's products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company's products and services, and requiring changes to the Company's business or supply chain. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.\n",
            "Risks and costs related to new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities may increase as the Company's products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company's employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company's policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company's business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company's products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.read moreLitigation & Legal Liabilities1 | 3.6%Litigation & Legal Liabilities - Risk 1The Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\n",
            "The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\n",
            "Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company's cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company's ability to offer certain products and services.\n",
            "The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company's ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Taxation & Government Incentives1 | 3.6%Taxation & Government Incentives - Risk 1The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\n",
            "The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company's effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company's taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Environmental / Social2 | 7.1%Environmental / Social - Risk 1Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company's business.Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of the Company's announced goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company's control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company's goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.Environmental / Social - Risk 2Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information with respect to the Company's customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "The Company's business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company's behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company's ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company's stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which can result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company's ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.\n",
            "Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\n",
            "The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company's or its suppliers' and other third parties' employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company's or such suppliers' or third parties' systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company's products and services.\n",
            "While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.read moreAbility to SellTotal Risks: 6/28 (21%)Above Sector AverageCompetition2 | 7.1%Competition - Risk 1Global markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.The Company's products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\n",
            "The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\n",
            "The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company's competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company's intellectual property, the Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\n",
            "The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company's competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\n",
            "Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company's product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company's approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\n",
            "The Company's services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\n",
            "The Company's business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company's ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.Competition - Risk 2To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software or other third-party support for the Company's products and services, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New products, services and technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially adversely impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.read moreSales & Marketing3 | 10.7%Sales & Marketing - Risk 1The Company's retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company's retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company's ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Sales & Marketing - Risk 2Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company's own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n",
            "The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers.\n",
            "Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.read moreSales & Marketing - Risk 3The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\n",
            "Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company's products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users' purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.\n",
            "The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers' stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company's products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company's products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products.read moreBrand / Reputation1 | 3.6%Brand / Reputation - Risk 1ChangedThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\n",
            "The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (\"APIs\") for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Although the Company's compliance plan is intended to address the DMA's obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\n",
            "The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \"performance smartphones\" and \"smartphones\" generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company's commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC (\"Google\") and other companies to offer their search services on the Company's platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024, Google was found to have violated U.S. antitrust laws. In connection with this finding, the DOJ has proposed remedies, which include changes to Google's products, services and business models. The proposed changes vary in scope and severity and range from imposing significant restrictions on Google's licensing agreements to prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for search distribution for up to 10 years. If implemented, such remedies could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to earn revenue from such licensing arrangements.\n",
            "There can be no assurance the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company's business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company's products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, lost sales, and lower profit margins.ProductionTotal Risks: 5/28 (18%)Above Sector AverageManufacturing1 | 3.6%Manufacturing - Risk 1The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company's products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company's services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a user's device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.Employment / Personnel1 | 3.6%Employment / Personnel - Risk 1The Company's success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company's ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.Much of the Company's future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company's key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company's culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\n",
            "The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Supply Chain2 | 7.1%Supply Chain - Risk 1The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company's flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company's hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company's cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or conflict.\n",
            "The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n",
            "Changes or additions to the Company's supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.Supply Chain - Risk 2Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company's business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.read moreCosts1 | 3.6%Costs - Risk 1The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n",
            "The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company's markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.Finance & CorporateTotal Risks: 4/28 (14%)Below Sector AverageShare Price & Shareholder Rights1 | 3.6%Share Price & Shareholder Rights - Risk 1The price of the Company's stock is subject to volatility.The Company's stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies' operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), and the Company's share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company's stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.Accounting & Financial Operations1 | 3.6%Accounting & Financial Operations - Risk 1The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.The Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company's products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company's gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company's services; the Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n",
            "The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company's logistics, supply or manufacturing partners.Debt & Financing1 | 3.6%Debt & Financing - Risk 1The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.The Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.Corporate Activity and Growth1 | 3.6%Corporate Activity and Growth - Risk 1Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company's ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company's ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Macro & PoliticalTotal Risks: 4/28 (14%)Above Sector AverageEconomy & Political Environment2 | 7.1%Economy & Political Environment - Risk 1The Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales. In addition, the Company's global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company's supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\n",
            "Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company's products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\n",
            "In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company's products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company's suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\n",
            "Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company's trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company's ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company's financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.Economy & Political Environment - Risk 2The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.Political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n",
            "The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company's business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company's business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the Company's business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business.\n",
            "Many of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company's and its suppliers' operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company's control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\n",
            "Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings, increase the Company's costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\n",
            "The Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company's business, and harm to the Company's reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company's operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\n",
            "Following any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.read moreCapital Markets2 | 7.1%Capital Markets - Risk 1The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company's exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 28, 2024, the Company's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.Capital Markets - Risk 2The Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n",
            "The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\n",
            "Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company's foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n",
            "The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.read moreTech & InnovationTotal Risks: 3/28 (11%)Below Sector AverageTrade Secrets1 | 3.6%Trade Secrets - Risk 1The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.The Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company's products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.Technology2 | 7.1%Technology - Risk 1The Company's business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company's or its vendors' business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company's business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company's online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company's products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Technology - Risk 2The Company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.\n",
            "The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n",
            "The Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n",
            "The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company's products.\n",
            "The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the European Union (\"EU\") as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the \"DMA\"), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (\"APIs\") for developers. Changes to the Company's products and services could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated.read moreSee a full breakdown of risk according to category and subcategory.

This is so that potential investors can consider any risks before they make an investment.They also offer companies protection, as a company can use risk factors as liability protection. This could happen if a company underperforms and investors take legal action as a result.It is worth noting that smaller companies, that is those with a public float of under $75 million on the last business day, do not have to include risk factors in their 10-K and 10-Q forms, although some may choose to do so.How do companies disclose their risk factors?Publicly traded companies initially disclose their risk factors to the SEC through their S-1 filings as part of the IPO process.Additionally, companies must provide a complete list of risk factors in their Annual Reports (Form 10-K) or (Form 20-F) for “foreign private issuers”.Quarterly Reports also include a section on risk factors (Form 10-Q) where companies are only required to update any changes since the previous report.According to the SEC, risk factors should be reported concisely, logically and in “plain English” so investors can understand them.How can I use TipRanks risk factors in my stock research?Use the Risk Factors tab to get data about the risk factors of any company in which you are considering investing.You can easily see the most significant risks a company is facing. Additionally, you can find out which risk factors a company has added, removed or adjusted since its previous disclosure. You can also see how a company’s risk factors compare to others in its sector.Without reading company reports or participating in conference calls, you would most likely not have access to this sort of information, which is usually not included in press releases or other public announcements.A simplified analysis of risk factors is unique to TipRanks.What are all the risk factor categories?TipRanks has identified 6 major categories of risk factors and a number of subcategories for each.

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses.

No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.\n",

            " In 2007, Apple, Inc. (AAPL) launched the iPhone to tremendous success. The vision of the company’s founder, Steve Jobs, came to fruition as Apple captured both mindshare and market share while redefining the hardware and software world. Along the way, it endeared itself to new generations of consumers.\n",
            " The resultant impact on the company's stock was even more impressive. In early January 2007, the price was around $3 to $4 and continued its rise through a global financial crisis to land around $227 in late 2024. With no end in sight, the rewards of holding AAPL seem limitless, but are there risks ahead that investors may be dangerously overlooking?\n",
            " Apple’s Rewards If you had been lucky (or some may call it brilliant) enough to envision the impact the iPhone would have on Apple’s earnings and margins and invested in the stock a decade ago, you would be ecstatic over the rewards garnered from your position. And while the stock has continually ignored the direction of the markets by moving (for the most part) in an upward trajectory, the question remains: Do the future rewards outweigh the risks? Let’s consider four points:\n",
            "Most analysts agree iPhone sales drive AAPL. Penetration into new markets, particularly the success of its venture in China, will largely determine if the company can produce strong year-over-year growth. The company can also explore new areas, such as game consoles, streaming services, watches, other “wearables,” and the TV/DVD/set-top box markets. And while these may produce avenues of future growth, they will not drive near-term (the next 18 months-two years) earnings growth like the expected growing domestic demand for the iPhone.\n",
            "In April 2014, the company announced a large capital return program in the form of share repurchases and dividend increases that rewarded shareholders. The expectation is that will be another similar announcement in 2015, the impact of which will be felt into 2016.\n",
            "Apple’s trailing price-to-earnings ratio is 17.1x (just slightly above the Standard & Poor’s valuation) with expected growth to outpace the market’s, making it an extremely attractive valuation.\n",
            "A strong cash position on its balance sheet is cited by many as a catalyst for growth, or at the very least, continued share repurchases. \n",
            " Apple’s Risks It is hard to compete with strong stock appreciation and anticipated continued strong growth, but there may be risks investors are overlooking.\n",
            " Again the focus is on the iPhone for near-term risks. A slowdown in the growth and penetration of the smartphone market could be exponentially more painful for Apple, as over half its current revenues come from its iPhone products. A slowdown in any of the following could materially reduce Apple’s multiple and stock price: overall smartphone market growth, iPhone market share growth, or penetration into China. Considering that analysts’ predictions for iPhone sales are bullish for this year, next year could show negative comps or a year-over-year decline, which would effectively knock down the stock's multiple. \n",
            " Future growth is dependent on new product categories or on a product that would redefine a current category. Some skeptics wonder why the company is so keen on returning its cash via share repurchases and dividends instead of re-investing into research and development or making acquisitions. There is the risk that the company will be unable to sustain its “innovative” strategy in the future because it is not putting that cash to work today to discover the technology of tomorrow. \n",
            " The Bottom Line Apple has been synonymous with growth and innovation, capturing all of a consumer’s technology dollars with its personal computing (Mac), smartphone (iPhone), and tablet (iPad) products, effectively raising switching costs to an undeniably high level. The risks lie in the company’s future ability to keep those consumers while drawing in new ones in more markets. New technology makes consumers fickle. They want the newest and best, and brand loyalty will be sacrificed to own the next greatest gadget. The risk is that Apple will not be in the running when the new wave comes rolling in. \n",

            " In 2007, Apple, Inc. (AAPL) launched the iPhone to tremendous success. The vision of the company’s founder, Steve Jobs, came to fruition as Apple captured both mindshare and market share while redefining the hardware and software world. Along the way, it endeared itself to new generations of consumers.\n",
            " The resultant impact on the company's stock was even more impressive. In early January 2007, the price was around $3 to $4 and continued its rise through a global financial crisis to land around $227 in late 2024. With no end in sight, the rewards of holding AAPL seem limitless, but are there risks ahead that investors may be dangerously overlooking?\n",
            " Apple’s Rewards If you had been lucky (or some may call it brilliant) enough to envision the impact the iPhone would have on Apple’s earnings and margins and invested in the stock a decade ago, you would be ecstatic over the rewards garnered from your position. And while the stock has continually ignored the direction of the markets by moving (for the most part) in an upward trajectory, the question remains: Do the future rewards outweigh the risks? Let’s consider four points:\n",
            "Most analysts agree iPhone sales drive AAPL. Penetration into new markets, particularly the success of its venture in China, will largely determine if the company can produce strong year-over-year growth. The company can also explore new areas, such as game consoles, streaming services, watches, other “wearables,” and the TV/DVD/set-top box markets. And while these may produce avenues of future growth, they will not drive near-term (the next 18 months-two years) earnings growth like the expected growing domestic demand for the iPhone.\n",
            "In April 2014, the company announced a large capital return program in the form of share repurchases and dividend increases that rewarded shareholders. The expectation is that will be another similar announcement in 2015, the impact of which will be felt into 2016.\n",
            "Apple’s trailing price-to-earnings ratio is 17.1x (just slightly above the Standard & Poor’s valuation) with expected growth to outpace the market’s, making it an extremely attractive valuation.\n",
            "A strong cash position on its balance sheet is cited by many as a catalyst for growth, or at the very least, continued share repurchases. \n",
            " Apple’s Risks It is hard to compete with strong stock appreciation and anticipated continued strong growth, but there may be risks investors are overlooking.\n",
            " Again the focus is on the iPhone for near-term risks. A slowdown in the growth and penetration of the smartphone market could be exponentially more painful for Apple, as over half its current revenues come from its iPhone products. A slowdown in any of the following could materially reduce Apple’s multiple and stock price: overall smartphone market growth, iPhone market share growth, or penetration into China. Considering that analysts’ predictions for iPhone sales are bullish for this year, next year could show negative comps or a year-over-year decline, which would effectively knock down the stock's multiple. \n",
            " Future growth is dependent on new product categories or on a product that would redefine a current category. Some skeptics wonder why the company is so keen on returning its cash via share repurchases and dividends instead of re-investing into research and development or making acquisitions. There is the risk that the company will be unable to sustain its “innovative” strategy in the future because it is not putting that cash to work today to discover the technology of tomorrow. \n",
            " The Bottom Line Apple has been synonymous with growth and innovation, capturing all of a consumer’s technology dollars with its personal computing (Mac), smartphone (iPhone), and tablet (iPad) products, effectively raising switching costs to an undeniably high level. The risks lie in the company’s future ability to keep those consumers while drawing in new ones in more markets. New technology makes consumers fickle. They want the newest and best, and brand loyalty will be sacrificed to own the next greatest gadget. The risk is that Apple will not be in the running when the new wave comes rolling in. \n",
