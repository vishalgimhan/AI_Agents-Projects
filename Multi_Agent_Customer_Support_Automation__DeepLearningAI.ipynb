            "## Step 1: Understand CrewAI and Crews\n",
            "CrewAI is a Python framework that enables the creation of autonomous AI agents. A Crew in CrewAI is a team of AI agents that work together to achieve complex tasks. Each agent in the Crew has a specific role, tools, and goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Step 2: Understand Memory in CrewAI\n",
            "Memory in CrewAI allows agents to store and retrieve information, enhancing their ability to collaborate and make decisions. \n",
            "\n",
            "## Step 3: Setting Up a Crew\n",
            "To set up a Crew, you need to:\n",
            "1. Install CrewAI using pip: `pip install crewai`\n",
            "2. Import CrewAI and define your agents, tools, and tasks.\n",

            "\n",
            "## Step 4: Adding Memory to a Crew\n",
            "To add memory to your Crew, you can use the `memory` parameter when creating a Crew. Here is an example:\n",
            "```python\n",
            "from crewai import Crew, Agent\n",
            "\n",
            "# Define agents\n",

            "# Create a Crew with memory\n",
            "crew = Crew(agents=[agent1], memory=True)\n",
            "```\n",
            "In this example, `memory=True` enables memory for the Crew.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Step 5: Using Memory in Agents\n",
            "Agents can use memory to store and retrieve information. You can access memory using the `memory` attribute of an agent:\n",

We're excited to have you on board and are committed to providing the best support possible. Below, you'll find a comprehensive guide on how to create a Crew, add memory, and kick it off.\n\n### Step1: Creating a Crew\n\nTo set up a Crew, you'll need to define its configuration. This includes specifying the agents that will be part of the Crew, their roles, and how they'll collaborate. Here's a basic example of how to create a Crew:\n\n```python\nfrom crewai import Crew, Agent\n\n# Define agents\nagent1 = Agent(\n role='Researcher',\n goal='Research the topic',\n backstory='Experienced researcher'\n)\n\nagent2 = Agent(\n role='Writer',\n goal='Write the report',\n backstory='Skilled writer'\n)\n\n# Create a Crew\ncrew = Crew(\n agents=[agent1, agent2],\n goal='Complete a research report'\n)\n```\n\n### Step2: Adding Memory to the Crew\n\nAdding memory to a Crew allows it to retain information across tasks and improve its performance over time. CrewAI provides a simple way to integrate memory into your Crew through the `memory` attribute:\n\n```python\nfrom crewai import Crew, Agent, Memory\n\n# Create a memory instance\nmemory = Memory(\n type='knowledge_graph',\n description='Stores knowledge as a graph'\n)\n\n# Define agents and create a Crew with memory\nagent1 = Agent(\n role='Researcher',\n goal='Research the topic',\n backstory='Experienced researcher'\n)\n\nagent2 = Agent(\n role='Writer',\n goal='Write the report',\n backstory='Skilled writer'\n)\n\ncrew = Crew(\n agents=[agent1, agent2],\n goal='Complete a research report',\n memory=memory\n)\n```\n\n### Step3: Kicking Off the Crew\n\nOnce your Crew is set up with memory, you can kick it off by calling the `kickoff` method. This method initiates the Crew's goal and begins the task:\n\n```python\n# Kick off the Crew\ncrew.kickoff()\n```\n\n### Additional Tips and References\n\n- **Crew Configuration**: Make sure to customize your Crew's configuration based on your specific needs. This includes defining agents with clear roles, goals, and backstories.\n- **Memory Types**: CrewAI supports different types of memory, such as `knowledge_graph` and `file_storage`. Choose the one that best fits your use case.\n- **Monitoring and Logging**: Keep an eye on your Crew's performance and logs to ensure everything is running smoothly.\n\nFor more detailed information and examples, I recommend checking out the [CrewAI documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/Creating-a-Crew-and-kick-it-off/).
